<P>RecView is a program for tomographic reconstruction and image processing. 
It consists of about 14,000 lines of custom source codes in C++, CUDA, and x86/x64 machine languages. RecView is designed for processing tomographic data obtained at the BL20B2, BL20XU, BL37XU, and BL47XU beamlines of the synchrotron radiation facility SPring-8 and also those taken at the 32-ID beamline of Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory.

<DIV class=interest_item>
<P><IMG width=100 height=140 alt=testPattern src="testPattern.png" align=left>
Three-dimensional structural analysis with micro/nanotomography is performed by recording two-dimensional x-ray images while rotating the sample. Then tomographic sections are calculated from the x-ray images by convolution back-projection method. This reconstruction calculation is repeated for each tomographic slice, giving the three-dimensional structure. RecView is a program for the tomographic reconstruction calculations with graphical user interfaces. Multiple data can be continuously processed by using its queueing dialog. Functions for zooming reconstruction (an example is shown left), Gaussian convolution, and many other procedures for image processing are also implemented. The resolution of real sample images can be estimated with a logarithmic plot in the Fourier domain by using this program.

  <LI>What kind of data can be processed?</LI>
    <DIV class=cv_item>
    RecView is designed for the reconstruction of tomographic data obtained at SPring-8 and APS. However, any kind of data can be processed. Please contact the author if you have problems in using this program with data from other tomographs. Dataset requirements are:
    <UL>
      <LI>We use file names beginning with alphabet characters followed by frame number, such as 'q0005.tif'.</LI>
      <LI>Place a dark-field image 'dark.tif' in the dataset folder.</LI>
      <LI>RecView also needs a paprameter file 'output.log' in plain text format (an example is given in the test dataset). This file has four fields:<BR>
<pre>
frame#      time(msec)     angle(deg) 0=flatfield/1=sample
00001       00012.46900    000.0000        0
00002       00019.26600    000.1000        1
00003       00021.34400    000.2000        1
00004       00023.43800    000.3000        1
00005       00025.51600    000.4000        1
...
01890       05298.43800    180.0000        1
01891       05310.65700    180.0000        0</pre>
          Spreadsheet softwares work well for manually generating this 'output.log' file. The 'time' fields are used for interpolating the trend of flatfield pixel intensities. <BR>The format of output.log files of recent SPring-8 sessions was revised to list angle in pulses instead of angle in degrees. The latest executable can recognize each format.

  <LI>How to try the test dataset?</LI>
    <DIV class=cv_item>
    <UL>
      <LI>Extract all files in the archived test dataset provided in <A href="https://github.com/mizutanilab/RecView">our GitHub site</a>.</LI>

      <LI>Open 'Tomography'-'Reconstruction...' dialog.</LI>
      <LI>Enter '380' in the 'From' layer field.</LI>
      <LI>Enter '311' in the 'From' rotation-center field.</LI>

    <DIV class=cv_item>
      No. However, remote folders such as workgroup PCs are searched when you open files. This is  performed by the Windows dialog function.
